The application includes functionalities related to connecting a user's wallet, sending transactions, fetching and displaying transaction history, and managing a dark/light theme toggle. The Ethereum interactions are facilitated by the ethers.js library, and the React framework is used for building the user interface, taking advantage of the blockchain technology, allowing you to send transactions and include a message and keyword which is stored on the blockchain immutably. This keyword is used to generate a corresponding GIF image that matches the keyword from the transaction details returned from the blockchain on the Ethereum blockchain after the transaction is completed.",
